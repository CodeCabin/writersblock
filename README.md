# WritersBlock JS

Simple WYSIWYG editor which uses content editables to create rich text content. 

## Loading Resources:

There are two primary source files which need to be loaded before initialization:

**Styles:**
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="writersblock/css/writersblock.css">
```

Styles should be loaded in the head, as part of the other media resources for your app. 

**Scripts:**

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="writersblock/js/writersblock.js"></script>
```

Scripts should be loaded in the footer.
